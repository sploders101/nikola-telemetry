# Nikola Telemetry

This project is currently a work in progress.

This project contains a gRPC proxy for using the Tesla Vehicle Command API and
Telemetry services. This proxy can be thought of as a one-stop-shop for
interacting with your Tesla vehicle, with the added benefit of automatic code
generation for API clients.

In addition, this service will automate much of the setup and maintenance of
the telemetry service (aka "Streaming Signals") so you can focus on your
application or integration.
